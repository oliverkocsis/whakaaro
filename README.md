# Problem

A roadmap is a strategic plan that defines a goal or desired outcome and includes the major steps or milestones needed to reach it ... but choosing the right ideas to be part of the roadmap is not a straightforward exercise due to 
- There might be thousands of ideas choosing from
- The oppinions of the importance of the idease might differ at each stakeholder
- Organizational politics might take over rational
- etc

# Solution

A digital ideabox where
- anyone can submit new ideas
- the minimal content of the ideas are defined (problem, solution, objective (metric), impact, effort, etc)
- anonymous voting on impact and effort (impoact by business stakeholders and effort by engineering teams)
- snapshot of metrics before the idea, snapshot of etrics after the idea
- organizational knowledgebase for ideas and their outcomes
